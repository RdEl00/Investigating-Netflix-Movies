## Investigating Netflix Movies

*Netflix!* The company started in 1997 as a DVD rental service has since exploded into the largest entertainment/media company by market capitalization, boasting over 200 million subscribers as of January 2021.

Given the large number of movies and series available on the platform, it is a perfect opportunity to flex my data manipulation skills and dive into the entertainment industry. 


It looks like there is something to the idea that movie lengths have decreased over the past ten years! There are a few questions about this trend that I'm going to answer, including:

- What does this trend look like over a longer period of time?
- Is this explainable by something like the genre of entertainment?
